Today, I am going to write a poem on Rainbows. Just because I recently saw a video by Coding Train and I want to practice things that he did. Ab toh bhai pariyaan bhi aa gyi, ab toh dabang machega. Ab toh alag level se hoga sab kuch.
So here I go.

There are a lot of colours in the rainbow and unicorn also, probably infinite.
But still the whole rainbow unicorn fits into a finite space. How can this happen that something infinite can fit into something finite.

Let's try to jot down all the colours of the Rainbow
Red
Orange
Purple
Unicorn
Pink
Green
Fairy
Skin
Magenta
Single-horned unicorn
Blue
Brown
Violet
Indigo

That's all what I remember. But now I also know about unicorns. Now, unicorns have transformed into fairies.
