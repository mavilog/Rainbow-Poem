Today, I am going to write a poem on Rainbows. Just because I recently saw a video by Coding Train and I want to practice things that he did.
So here I go.

There are a lot of colours in the rainbow, probably infinite.
But still the whole rainbow fits into a finite space. How can this happen that something infinite can fit into something finite.

Let's try to jot down all the colours of the Rainbow
Red
Orange
Purple
Green
Skin
Magenta
Blue
Brown
Violet
Indigo

That's all what I remember.
